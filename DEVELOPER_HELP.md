# Developer Help: Running the Website Locally

Welcome! If you are new to this project, here is how to get started as a developer:

## 1. Install Node.js

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher). Download and install it if you don't have it already.

## 2. Install Project Dependencies

In your terminal, run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages.

## 3. Start the Development Server (with Watching)

To develop and see your changes live, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This starts a local server and enables "watching mode"â€”any changes you make will automatically rebuild and reload the site in your browser.

## 4. Build the Site Once (Production Build)

To generate the static site files for deployment, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This runs Eleventy once and outputs the final static website. No server or watching is started.

---

**Summary:**

- Use `npm run start` for development (with live reload and watching for changes).
- Use `npm run build` for a one-time build (no watching, for production or deployment).

This project uses [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) as the static site generator. For more details, see the [README.md](README.md#local-development) or the [Eleventy documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/).
